eBUS adapter
============

This repository is for creating the [online documentation](https://ebus.github.io/adapter/) of an eBUS adapter for communicating with eBUS devices connected to a 2-wire bus system ("energy bus" used by numerous heating systems).

The documentation is available in German only for the time being, which is subject to be changed.
